    <h1>Vote Poster</h1>
    <h3>What is this poster?</h3>
    <p>This poster was created in Adobe Illustrator for the course New Media Design Elements in the fall of 2018. 
        The goal was to create a poster to encourage a younger demographic to go out and vote.
        Though it could be seen as controversial, I chose to take on the angle of gun violence.
