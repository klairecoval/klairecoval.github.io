    <h1>Galapagos Email Flyer</h1>
    <h3>What is this flyer?</h3>
    <p>This flyer is a redesign of an email flyer sent out to the RIT student body in the fall of 2018.
        It was created in Adobe Illustrator for New Media Design Elements.
        The first three versions of the flyer demonstrate use of hierarchy while using only one font.
        The last versoin utilizes two fonts.
        No additional content has been added or drastically changed from the original flyer - it has only been condensed.
