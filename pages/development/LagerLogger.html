    <h1>LagerLogger</h1>
    <p>Lager Logger is a beer-tracker that helps users keep track of their favorite beers,
            recommends recipes to use with beer, and suggests pairings to go with your desired type
            of beer. Users can enter the name of their beer, its brewer, the type of beer it is, the ABV, its
            bitterness level, and the types of “notes” it may have. User can also log their favorite
            breweries with the brewery’s name, location, link to website, and general comments on the
            atmosphere or why they liked it.
