    <h1>Asteroids: The Pollinator Edition</h1>
    <h3>What is Asteroids?</h3>
    <p>This version of asteroids fun and new take on the classic video game, Asteroids. Instead of bullets shot at asteroids
        in space by a spaceship, the player floats around as a beehive and shoots bees at flowers. It was created in the spring of 2018 for the course Interactive Medial Development.

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Invincibility mode: allows the user to take no damage and position themselves in preparation for the game. Bullets have no
            effect when in this mode.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ranking: a ranking system displays the players rank according to their score.
        </li>
        <li>
            Delay: there is a delay in asteroid effectiveness when the game starts up. This is done for a similar reason as invincibility
